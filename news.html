          <h3>Sunshine Bay Wins Platinum Trophy in 2024 MUSE Design Awards</h3>
          <div class="line-clamp">
            <p>Mercurio Design Lab’s latest project, Sunshine Bay, recently won a Platinum trophy in the Architectural Design – Conceptual category of the 2024 MUSE Design Awards’ first season. This victory marks MDL’s return to the prestigious MUSE Awards, where it last won a Silver accolade in 2022 for iLiv@Grange.</p>
              <p>Sunshine Bay stands as MDL’s inaugural project in Dubai’s vibrant architectural scene, with the 13-storey residential complex already making waves thanks to its unique, sailboat-inspired form. Its balconies are arrayed in gentle curves, creating a façade akin to a sail, which zigs and zags with the seaborne winds. This curvilinear tower section sits atop a podium, which in turn resembles the dual skids of a catamaran, complete with a deck-like canopy with wooden flooring.</p>
              <p>MUSE’s Platinum award is behind only in stature to the coveted Design of the Year award, which MDL won back in 2021 with Dusit Thani Laguna. Created in 2015 by the International Awards Associate, the MUSE Design Awards is an international competition that showcases the world’s top designers, whose visionary creations enthral and amaze, redefining boundaries and scope—much like a muse.<a href="https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/landscape/6372-villa-mistral-by-mercurio-design-lab-s-r-l/" title="Sunshine Bay Wins Platinum Trophy in 2024 MUSE Design Awards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Read more &raquo;</a></p>
